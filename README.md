# ROAD-SEGMENTATION-USING-UNET-ARCHITECTURE
USED THE UNET ARCHITECTURE FOR SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION ON  ROADS.</p>
## WORKFLOW
1. IMAGE PREPROCESSING: WHICH INVOLVES READING THE IMAGE, RESIZING IT AND NORMALIZING THE PIXEL VALUES ( i.e. [0-255] -> [0-1])
2. LABEL PREPROCESSING: DATASET WAS FOR MULTI CLASS SEGMENTATION, MADE IT BINARY.
3. DEFINING THE MODEL AND COMPILING IT RIGHTLY.
4. TRAINING THE MODEL AND SAVING WEIGHTS
5. MAKING OUT PREDICTION BY DEFINING A PIPELINE OF PREPROCESSING FOR NEWLY FEEDED IMAGE.
